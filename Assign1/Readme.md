### Assignment 1
Directory for assignment 1 stuffs

#### Project Analyze Docs
1. Just run the pull command, things will become too much of a mess if I do something more complicated
2. Run git diff to get the uncommitted changes, outputs printed into changes.log w/ lines numbered and all that as they appear in the code source, also clean up some things
5. See features for all the "features" included, apparently the OP people are doing 5+

#### Features
1. uncommitted files (including staged) will be displayed at the beginning of changes.log (cause I can't be bothered to just toss out those couple hours of work)
