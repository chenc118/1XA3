### Assignment 1
Directory for assignment 1 stuffs

#### Project Analyze Docs
1. Just run the pull command, things will become too much of a mess if I do something more complicated
2. Run git diff to get the uncommitted changes, outputs printed into changes.log w/ lines numbered and all that as they appear in the code source, also clean up some things
3. Gets todo with # and // in front
5. See features for all the "features" included, apparently the OP people are doing 5+

#### Features
1. uncommitted files (including staged) will be displayed at the beginning of changes.log (cause I can't be bothered to just toss out those couple hours of work)
2. Git diff is "fancy" (I'll count this as a feature since no one else is doing something like this, at least from the git repo names I can guess)
3. TODO is "fancy" (Again cause literally no one else is doing anything special except copying a grep command)
4. requirement 3 has // as well for practicality reasons as I code in java
5.(maybe) report arg will result in logs created being in html format and viewable as such, (for more editing options using CSS/HTML)
6. Arguments to change things someday

##### Notes:

Some things that are different from other's cause of the intended useage

1. No prompts cause I'll maybe add this to some sort of other script thingy if I ever use it and have it execute w/ just cli args, prompts makes things easier to mess up
2. Does everything at once for the same above reason(easier to run as a part of some other code), may add args to supress certain behaviors
