CV - [CV Page](chenc118.github.io)
App - [Play Elm.Agar.Io](chenc118.github.io/projects/Elm.Agar.Io/)


#### CV pAGE

Modified version of the CeeVee template by Styleshout. Custom css bits in the custom.css file. 

#### App - Elm.agar.io

Based somewhat on agar.io after doing a bunch of stuff to transform the code from Elm lab 02. Plays almost exactly the same and is designed for singleplayer. First web app so code is a mess and probably not organized in the best way.

##### Features

- Custom name selection
- Unlimited name length
- Custom image selection
- FPS display option
- Custom color selection
- keyboard/mouse control options
- Pause menu

- Maybe I'll get to these in the future when I'm bored
- TODO Custom board size?
- TODO more controls in terms of hacking the game
- TODO more efficient algorithms (Considering some sort of Grouping so less compare ops are needed)
